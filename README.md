a gross way to make a folder of MP3's a podcast

The tl;dr;, I have a folder of podcast MP3s and I wanted them on my zune.

The folder name is the name of the podcast.
The files in the folder, ending in MP3 will be added to the resulting XML

This means you can just go to http://mypodcastserver.local/podcastName/podcast.php and you will just have working podcast xml
